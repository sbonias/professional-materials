# Professional Materials

## Description

Updated my personal portfolio that is hosted on Github to include my top 4 projects thus far. I incorporated the COVID-19 Tracker from Project 1, the Weather Dashboard, and the Password Generator, and the Kids Booktivist application to my portolio page. I also updated the portfolio pages code to include modals in order to present each application in a more clear and concise manner that includes: an application description, the deployed link, and the github repository. Additionally, I've updated my sticky footer to include links to my personal github profile, linkedin site, as well as my resume. I also updated my resume and continued to expand on my LinkIn page.
